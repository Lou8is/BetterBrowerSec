# BetterBrowerSec

This is a browser extension aimed at improving security. It is only a small personnal project.

At the moment, it is not available on extension stores.

### How does it work?

It uses the 1M list from https://tranco-list.eu/ and block requests for which the domain does not exists in this list.

### Is it perfect ?
No, it is not even finished

### (Possibly) Upcoming improvements (no specific order)
- Publish on store(s)
- Larger list, select size to consider (should be possible up to 10M without too much trouble)
- Session allowlist
- Persisted allowlist
- Automatic list update
- Other security features, tbd
